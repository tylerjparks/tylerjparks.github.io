The Skills-Outcome Extraction and Comparison process is a tool being developed to connect employers in-industry to students graduating from academia. In order to understand what employers are looking for, we can analyze employerâ€™s career pages and job postings. Those mediums are primary sources for identifying the required skills and knowledge that students need in order to work in those roles. From the scraping of website data, to keyword identification, and clustering and classification of skills -- this tool attempts to bridge the gap between potential employee and employer.
